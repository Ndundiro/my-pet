        <h1>My pet-Migs</h1>
        <p>I have a dog pet by the name migs.Though not the exotic kind of dog breeds,he is still one of a kind.He is not your every kind of "mbwa mwitu",though he looks like one.</p>
        <p>Migs is a very playful fellow.He lights me up whenever am down.Sometimes he annoys me too.</p>
        <p>Last week he did something extraordinary.He rescued a piglet from a school of angry dogs.They are his mates but he decided to do something good.I think they don't like him anymore.He will have to find other dog friends.</p>
